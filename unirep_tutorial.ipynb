Joint recurrent/ top model training has been tested on p3.2xlarge, which has 16G of GPU RAM and 64G of system RAM. To see a demonstration of joint training on your laptop, please run  unirep_tutorial_64_unit.ipynb, which is the same architecture and interface except for 64 hidden units in 4 stacked layers."
